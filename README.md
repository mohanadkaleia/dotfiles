## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- macOS (currently only supported OS)
- Python 3.x
- Xcode Command Line Tools

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dotfiles.git
   cd dotfiles
   ```

2. **Install everything**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   
   The script will:
   - Ask if you want to bootstrap your OS (install tools)
   - Backup your existing dotfiles
   - Link the dotfiles from this repo to your home directory

### Modifying Vim Configuration
Edit `.vimrc` to add or remove plugins. After changes, run in Vim:
```vim
:PluginInstall
```

# How it works
This will ask you to bootstrap your OS by installing a bunch of tools (you can see and customize whatever you need by modifying `install.sh` file). You can skip this step if you want. Then the script will backup your dotfiles specified by the `FILES_TO_TRACK` variable in the `main.py` file. Then will link the dot files from this project with your home directory. 

# Prerequisit
Nothing, only `Python` üêç

1. **Permission Denied**: Make sure you have Xcode Command Line Tools installed
   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```

2. **Homebrew Issues**: If Homebrew fails to install, try:
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

3. **GitHub Authentication Issues**: 
   - For HTTPS: Use Personal Access Token instead of password
   - For SSH: Ensure SSH key is added to GitHub account
   - See GitHub's authentication documentation for details

4. **Vim Plugins Not Working**: Run in Vim:
   ```vim
   :PluginInstall
